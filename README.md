# ChannelFactory Coding Test

The challenge was to design an API which would call a Google API to display the distance between two addresses. 

They specified several requirements:

- Make it scalable. 
- The addresses had to be displayed properly formatted.
- Display the distance between the two addresses
- Those addresses had to be geocoded.
- Make it usable for placenames. 

I chose the Google Places API because it fit those requirements perfectly. 

According to their feedback, I was rejected for calling Google Places API from the front end. 

It did not matter to them whether this API was designed to be called from the frontend or not. 

I thought I built a lovely reusable component for the autocomplete inputs, which I'm proud of.

To run locally you need to plug in Google API key in my index.html in the frontend.
